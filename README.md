# Drum-Kit
Play the Drums in Your Browser! (HTML/CSS/JS)
This project lets you play a drum kit right on your computer!    
Use your keyboard or touch the drum pads to make different percussion sounds.

Here's what you can do:
Play sounds for instruments like kick drum, snare, hi-hat, cymbals, and toms.
Hit the drums on your keyboard (assigned keys are easy to remember!).
Tap the drum pads on your touchscreen device for a more realistic feel.

Want to add more sounds or change them up?  
The code is easy to understand, so you can make it your own!
